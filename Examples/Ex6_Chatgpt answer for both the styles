For the problem statement i mentioned, i have given 2 solutions, one is written by me by trying and one is written by my tutor, which one is correct? or both are correct? Which is one is code efficient ? so that i practice according

Both solutions achieve the desired functionality of calculating and displaying the letter grade based on a given numerical score. However, there are differences in coding style and efficiency between the two solutions.

Let's analyze them:

Your Solution (Solution 1):

It directly prints the grade inside each condition block.
It has an additional nested if condition to handle scores below 60.
It does not use a character variable to store the grade.
Tutor's Solution (Solution 2):

It assigns the grade to a character variable.
It directly prints the grade after the if-else ladder.
It avoids the nested if condition for scores below 60.
Both solutions are correct in terms of functionality, but the tutor's solution is slightly more efficient and cleaner in terms of code readability. It uses a character variable to store the grade and directly prints the grade after the if-else ladder without nested conditions. Additionally, it avoids unnecessary nested conditions.

To improve your coding efficiency, you could adopt some practices from the tutor's solution, such as using a character variable to store the grade and avoiding unnecessary nested conditions. These practices can make your code cleaner and easier to understand.
